## State of art/Research:

Calendars have existed for thousands of years and have gone through several reforms until finally arriving at the currently widely used version, known as the Gregorian calendar. It is a solar calendar, meaning that it is based on the Earth&#39;s revolution around the Sun. Despite its seeming simplicity and ease-of-use, the rules which lay the foundation for the Gregorian calendar and its predecessors result in some complications. A year is not an exact integer of days, despite being presented as such. That is why certain years have a &quot;leap day&quot;, an additional day in the year, to compensate for the inaccuracy.
